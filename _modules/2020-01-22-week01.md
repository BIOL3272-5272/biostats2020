### wk1. Welcome / What is stats (Weds Jan 22). Intro to R (Fri Jan 24)

## Class 1 - W 1/22 Intro/What is Stats
**Homework due:** [Preclass survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1b3ImrqCq41fqGlJkupdfaFnZQxu502GkTZ7YbqPixtc/).   

**Description:** On the first day of class we will settle in and get to know one another and set expectations for the course. 
*Lecture slides* Are avialable here. Note that these are the slides from my lecture. Not the slides you need for the class work.  

**Classwork**: In class you will work through the slides I made to accompany the first chapter of the textbook, on "Statistics and samples" [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10LoIiCXo_mQWX3FN8DprTFlH_yQJSaBb), and answer these [questions](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0Bze1RelLJCQRMDlaNGZHcnZyR3FDTVlETGx6dlRXdDN2TDNz) passed out as a handout. Please hand in to Chaochih as you leave today. 

**Note:** The material in this first chapter IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STUFF IN THE BOOK. It's easy to think you get it, but is worth deep reflection / thought. Sampling bias is the most serious issue in stats.

**Resources:**  
- Chapter 1 of Whitlock and Schluter.  
- Slides for [Ch_01](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10LoIiCXo_mQWX3FN8DprTFlH_yQJSaBb).

## Class 3 - M 1/27 Organizing, Summarizing, and Dealing with data

**Homework due:** DUE 1/27 in class. [Hw_02](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0Bze1RelLJCQRdUNoYjRxQWVSTGVjMk9oTWhlUXB4NnhQMjdV), based off of [Slides from Ch_03 (describing data)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Jc2R21KqvKaZjbl3j-V0X89e-Iy-aK87)  and [Slides about dealing with data](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1PxsOljXIuhT_iAsUqpuajYPeZnmuUZZP).

**Description:** We (almost) never on the true population parameters, but we can take sample estimates. We generally want to summarize both *central tendency* (mean, median, mode), as well as *width* (variance, coefficient of variation, interquartile range etc). Tidy data is easier to summarize and transform than untidy data, (read more about good spreadsheet organization [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) and tidy data [here](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)). We make use of the [dplyr package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) to summarize and transform our data, while the [tidyr package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) can tidy messy data.

**Resources:** .
- Chapter 3 of Whitlock and Schluter, [Ch_03 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Jc2R21KqvKaZjbl3j-V0X89e-Iy-aK87), and accompanying  [R Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PxsOljXIuhT_iAsUqpuajYPeZnmuUZZP).
- [optional, most useful] RStudio primers on [summarizing](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2) and [tidying](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4) data.
- [optional, second most useful] Useful readings for R tips from R for data Science: Ch_05 [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html), and Ch_12 [tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).
- [optional, least useful] Fun readings for thinking on [organizing data in spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989), and the [idea of tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf).



**Classwork**:  [Worksheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qbCkcX0z8lzIX_JpkkyCDo3Tkv1SI8qx) turn in worksheet [here](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/151855/assignments/996524), [Data set](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N0X_CiwcXOsPeetRpclHlLjGSHPkT-L2).

**QUIZ** [Quiz](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/151855/quizzes/236368).

**Note:** We can tidy messy data sets, but it's a pain. Better to organize initial data cleanly.

**Homework assigned:**  DUE 1/29 in class received a hand out in class on firday but it is also here [Hw_03](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Uc7DwRYj0GYG_yAk3wmuMTCkuQxfnoCD), based off of [Ch_02 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10u34nhPadkPAiTB9wv8NDaeCIYj9NNQW).


## Class 4 - W 1/29 Making good figures

**Homework due:** DUE 1/29 in class. You should receive a hand out in class but it is also here [Hw_03](https://drive.google.com/a/umn.edu/uc?authuser=1&id=0Bze1RelLJCQRLWhVSURRQmZmSlRCbGEwMDQtbFJYelBkeE8w&export=download), based off of [Ch_02 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10u34nhPadkPAiTB9wv8NDaeCIYj9NNQW) + [Calling Bullshit](https://callingbullshit.org/videos.html) + [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).

**Description:** ABV - Always Be Visualizing. Looking at data gives us an understanding that we can miss from simple data summaries, so exploratory data visualization is the first step of any analysis. Data visualization can also guide readers towards the important results in our data, so explanatory visualizations are often the final step in our analysis. A good data visualization (1) shows the data (2) make patterns easy to see (3) displays magnitudes honestly, and (4) draws graphics clearly. The ggplot2 package in R can help us make good figures.

**Resources:**
- Chapter 2 of Whitlock and Schluter, [Ch_02 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10u34nhPadkPAiTB9wv8NDaeCIYj9NNQW).
- [optional, most useful] [RStudio primers on visualizing](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) data.
- [optional, second most useful] Useful readings for R tips from R for data Science: Ch_04 [Data Visualization](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html), and Ch_07 [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html).

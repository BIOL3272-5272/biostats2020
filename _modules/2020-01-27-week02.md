### Week 2 Material 1/27 - 1/31. M Intro to data. W Making good figures. F Estimation with uncertainty Pt I. 

## Class 3 - M 1/27 Organizing, Summarizing, and Dealing with data. 


**Resources:**    
- Chapter 3 of Whitlock and Schluter, [Ch_03 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Jc2R21KqvKaZjbl3j-V0X89e-Iy-aK87), and accompanying  [R Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PxsOljXIuhT_iAsUqpuajYPeZnmuUZZP).     
- [optional, most useful] RStudio primers on [summarizing](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2) and [tidying](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4) data.  
- [optional, second most useful] Useful readings for R tips from R for data Science: Ch_05 [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html), and Ch_12 [tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html). 
- [optional, least useful] Fun readings for thinking on o[rganizing data in spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989), and the [idea of tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf).


**Homework due:** DUE 1/27 in class. [Hw_02](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0Bze1RelLJCQRbjREWmlaTDFYMEl5UWFRSkdWbWx6cTVEQTIw), based off of [Slides from Ch_03 (describing data)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Jc2R21KqvKaZjbl3j-V0X89e-Iy-aK87)  and [Slides about dealing with data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PxsOljXIuhT_iAsUqpuajYPeZnmuUZZP).

**Description:** We (almost) never on the true population parameters, but we can take sample estimates. We generally want to summarize both *central tendency* (mean, median, mode), as well as *width* (variance, coefficient of variation, interquartile range etc). Tidy data is easier to summarize and transform than untidy data, (read more about good spreadsheet organization [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) and tidy data [here](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)). We make use of the [dplyr package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) to summarize and transform our data, while the [tidyr package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) can tidy messy data. 

**Classwork**: TBD. 

**Note:** We can tidy messy data sets, but it's a pain. Better to organize initial data cleanly. 


**Homework assigned:**  DUE 1/29 in class. You should receive a hand out in class but it is also here [Hw_03](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Uc7DwRYj0GYG_yAk3wmuMTCkuQxfnoCD), based off of [Ch_03 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10u34nhPadkPAiTB9wv8NDaeCIYj9NNQW) + [Calling Bullshit](https://callingbullshit.org/videos.html) + [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/). 


## Class 4 - W 1/29 Making good figures

**Resources:**    
- Chapter 2 of Whitlock and Schluter, [Ch_02 Slides](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10u34nhPadkPAiTB9wv8NDaeCIYj9NNQW).
- [optional, most useful] RStudio primers on visualizing](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) data.  
- [optional, second most useful] Useful readings for R tips from R for data Science: Ch_04 [Data Visualization](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html), and Ch_07 [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html).

**Description:** ABV - Always Be Visualizing. Looking at data gives us an understanding that we can miss from simple data summaries, so exploratory data visualization is the first step of any analysis. Data visualization can also guide readers towards the important results in our data, so explanatory visualizations are often the final step in our analysis. A good data visualization (1) shows the data (2) make patterns easy to see (3) displays magnitudes honestly, and (4) draws graphics clearly. The ggplot2 package in R can help us make good figures. 

**Classwork**: TBD. 

**Note:** Have fun! This is my favorite stuff.

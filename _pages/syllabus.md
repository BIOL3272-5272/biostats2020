# BIOL 3272/5272 (001) Applied Biostatistics (Spring 2020)

**Overall teaching philosophy.**  
I view teaching and learning as a collaboration. This means, that in addition to engaging with the material, scholars should engage with how they are learning / how I am teaching and how this can be improved. Feedback regarding teaching effectiveness / workload etc.. is highly encouraged. I hope to work together with you to make this a fantastic course!

**What has changed this term and why.**  
In our attempts to improve the course I have made numerous changes this term (below). As these parts of the course have changed, they could be improved by student feedback.  

The most significant change is that we will cover major concepts etc… at home by reading the slides (and/or) book. You are responsible for working through this before class, and there will be low stakes homeworks and quizzes every class to ensure you're keeping up with it.  That said, you don't need to memorize or even understand everything in the slides, come to class with questions, and goals! This will allow us to do more coding and thinking together in class. I am hoping this decreases your workload and pain, while increasing your abilities in R your understanding of statistics.

**Goals: What you should learn**   
"By the end of this course...:  

*Students should be statistical thinkers.* Students will recognize that data are comprised of observations that partially reflect chance sampling, & that a major goal of statistics is to incorporate this idea of chance into our interpretation of observations. Thinking this way can be challenging because it is a fundamentally new way to think about the world. Once this is mastered, much of the material follows naturally. Until then, it’s more confusing.  

*Students should think about probability quantitatively.* That chance influences observations is CRITICAL to statistics (see above). Quantitatively translating these probabilities into distributions and associated statistical tests allows for mastery of the topic. 

*Students should recognize how bias can influence our results.* Not only are results influenced by chance, but factors outside of our focus can also drive results. Identifying subtle biases and non-independence is key to conducting and interpreting statistics.  

*Students should become familiar with standard statistical tools / approaches and when to use them.* Recognize how bias can influence our results. What is the difference between bayesian and frequentist thinking? How can data be visualized effectively? Which standard statistical tests should be used in a given scenario? What is a p-value? What is the difference between statistical and real-world significance? How do we responsibly present/ interpret statistical results? We will grapple with & answer these questions over the term. 

*Students should be able to conduct the entire process of data analysis in R.* Students will be able to utilize the statistical language, R, to summarize, analyze, and combine data to make appropriate visualizations and to conduct appropriate statistical tests.

**Pragmatic Stuff**     
- *Prof office hours* TBD   
- *TA office hours* TBD   
- *Group study times* TBD.    
- *Textbook*: The Analysis of Biological Data By Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter [link to book website, which has good resources](https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/). It is not required, but you will use it heavily & students have loved it. Any edition is ok.   
- *Other resources* Can be found [here](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).   
- *Computers in class:* We will do a lot of computer work in class, so bring your computers to each session. If you cannot bring a computer to class, email yaniv, and he will find a loaner. While we NEED computers they also provide distractions and hinder performance Of you AND your neighbors. So you are discouraged from using computers in class during lectures discussion [close your laptops please].  

**Grad and honors students:** Will have additional assignments & exam qs. These can be completed as extra credit by the rest of the class. I will make grad / honors topics clear. I recognize that different graduate students need different things and are coming from different starting spots, so let's all talk about this. 

**Grading**    
*Grades:* 10% Classwork / Participation / Quizzes | 10% Regular homework (graded for effort) | 30% Midterm + Final | 10%  Lower stakes tests | 30% Problem sets | 10% Final Porject   * This is an approximate breakdown.

|min %  | 98   | 95   | 90  | 87  | 83  |80   |77   |74   |70   |  67 | 64  | 60  |0   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Grade   | A+  |A   |A-   | B+  | B  | B-  | C+  | C  | C-  | D+  | D  |D-   | F  |
|  GP | 4  | 4  | 11/3  | 10/3  |3   |8/3   |7/3   | 2  | 5/3  | 4/3  |1   |2/3   |0   |  


- *Class Participation:* SHOW UP EVERYDAY THAT YOU CAN. (Nearly) Every day there is a low stakes quiz andclasswork due. In addition you can lose attendance points by (1) Being a poor team member (2) Not engaging with questions when called on, or (3)  Being disruptive. If you must miss a cass let me know, and we'll make sure you keep up.   
- *Frequent low stakes quizzes & or classwork:*  Most classes will include a small quiz and / or in-class work.      
- *Homework:* There will be homework for each class. Mosy often this involves reading the slides and answering some questions about them. Turn in the homework as peice of paper, ideally with hand-written answers.    
- *Project*  A major goal of the course is to have students responsibly analyze real data. There will be one major independent data analysis project and numerous group projects. 
- *Tests/problem sets:* There will be a midterm and a final + a few lowe two exams over the term.   

*Policy on Homework:* Unexcused late homework / projects / class work / problem sets are not accepted. If, for some reason, you will not be able to complete the homework on time, email me AT LEAST 12 hours before the assignment is due, to make appropriate arrangements.


**Schedule**  
A tentative schedule is available [here](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/schedule/). Note that this is flexible, and that we will likely revisit the schedule near spring break, and adapt to student interests, paces etc...  

**Policy on Letters of Recommendation**  
We could potentially serve as letter writers for e.g. grad school, med school, law school, internships, jobs, etc… However to do so requires that we know more about you than your grade. If you hope to receive a strong recommendation, we encourage showing additional interest and engagement in data analysis and statistical issues outside of the standard assignments. I will notify you at the end of term if I believe I can write you a strong letter.  Otherwise, I can only write a short letter Student X got a score of Y in this course. Even if your score is 100% this does not provide information above and beyond your grade and will not help your admissions case.  

**Policy on Missed Exams**   
Students with a verified illness or family emergency will be allowed to make up a missed exam or quiz.  Students with a conflict due to a religious observance or University sponsored events will be allowed to make up a missed exam provided they make arrangements with the instructor at least 48 hours before the exam.  

**Grade Disputes**   
All grade disputes should be submitted in writing to the instructor within one week of receiving the graded assignment or exam. If the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, the assignment will be given to an expert outside of class to provide input. The entire assignment or exam (not just the points under dispute) will be re-graded, possibly resulting in lowered or raised grades.  

**Reasonable Accommodations**    
The University of Minnesota is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students.  The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attentional, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical), please contact the DRC at 612-626-1333 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. If you are registered with the DRC and have a current letter requesting reasonable accommodations, we encourage you to contact your instructor early in the semester to review how the accommodations will be applied in the course. Additional information is available on the [DRC website](https://diversity.umn.edu/disability/) 

In June 2006, the Provost’s Committee on Student Mental Health developed and endorsed the use of the following syllabus statement to inform students of campus resources:

*As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety. alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University  of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing.  You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu   

**Notification on Final Grades**  
To ensure there has been no mistake in calculation, students will be informed of their final grade before they are submitted.

**Student Conduct Code**   
As a student at the University you are expected to adhere to Board of Regents Policy: Student Conduct Code. To review the Student Conduct Code, please see this [link](https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/2019-09/policy_student_conduct_code.pdf).  

**Scholastic Dishonesty**   
You are expected to do your own academic work and cite sources as necessary. Failing to do so is scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis.  [Student Conduct Code](https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/2019-09/policy_student_conduct_code.pdf). If it is determined that a student has cheated, he or she may be given an "F" or an "N" for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University. For additional information, please see [university policies](https://policy.umn.edu/education/instructorresp).

**Make up work for Legitimate absences**    
Students will not be penalized for absence during the semester due to unavoidable or legitimate circumstances. Such circumstances include verified illness, participation in intercollegiate athletic events, subpoenas, jury duty, military service, bereavement, and religious observances. Such circumstances do not include voting in local, state, or national elections. For complete information, please see this link.

**Appropriate student use of classroom notes and materials**      
Taking notes is a means of recording information but more importantly of personally absorbing and integrating the educational experience. However, broadly disseminating class notes beyond the classroom community or accepting compensation for taking and distributing classroom notes undermines instructor interests in their intellectual work product while not substantially furthering instructor and student interests in effective learning. Such actions violate shared norms/standards of the academic community. For additional information, please see this [link](https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentresp).  

**Grading and Transcripts**    
The University utilizes plus and minus grading on a 4.000 cumulative grade point scale (see above, and this [link](https://policy.umn.edu/education/gradingtranscripts))

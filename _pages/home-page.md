## Textbook

“The Analysis of Biological Data” by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter

- It is highly recommended, but not required. Any edition will do.
- Students who have bought the book have really appreciated it, especially when they read it before class

### Equipment Requirement

As a modern statistics course, we conduct data analysis, generate figures etc in the R statistical language. Every student needs to bring a laptop computer with R installed to the class (we will help you with R installation in the first class). Email us with questions and / or if you cannot bring a computer to class, and we will work something out.

Other resources / books of interest / resources we may use / you might find useful can be found on the [Additional Resources page](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).

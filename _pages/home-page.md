**UPDATE. April 10**. 

1. Poisson homework posted. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y4tQjMuM_bdY8mr7opB_Ihm-92mVTQKm/view?usp=sharing), turn it in on [canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/151855/assignments/1072455). Based on poisson regression [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TruFWnNqHG8VmpcYeX_kGF4uy62_B9gK/view?usp=sharing) and [lecture](https://youtu.be/KmW65FHnX4k).

2. Key to logistic regression [homework](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fcLvNg3N9n9wA1L4npfozI9K8LNlKbLf) and [q1](https://youtu.be/-nvIV7Hcd2w) and [q2](https://youtu.be/tdbLRuNq1Vg) of classwork.

3. Please email me with ideas for a project, or guidance on how to get started if you have no clue [I imagine that those of you without a data source will need help getting something off the ground... if so, include your  scientific & statistical interests and what you hope to get out of the project]

Chaochih Office Hours - add code review requests to [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133gwjcjJF6nAep2pu2oa2Qb3wC1K3mBxucm-1HmA5Xo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Textbook

“The Analysis of Biological Data” by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter

- It is highly recommended, but not required. Any edition will do.
- Students who have bought the book have really appreciated it, especially when they read it before class

### Equipment Requirement

As a modern statistics course, we conduct data analysis, generate figures etc in the R statistical language. Every student needs to bring a laptop computer with R installed to the class (we will help you with R installation in the first class). Email us with questions and / or if you cannot bring a computer to class, and we will work something out.

Other resources / books of interest / resources we may use / you might find useful can be found on the [Additional Resources page](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).

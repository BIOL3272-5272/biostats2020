We will **(1)** go over the exam **(2)** go over the R assessment  **(3)** discuss the final project **(4)** discuss plans moving forward  **(5)** go over ANOVA homework if you have questions **(6)**  Figure out zoom / zoom rooms etc. 

- *Change in due dates for you*:  
    -  **(1)** Corrections for the R assessment will be accepted until Tuesday night at midnight [key here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dilQVJww58xlWrKeSTdUliqDtYO0TvUA), turn it in [here](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/151855/assignments/1027811).     
    -  **(2)** The [ANOVA homework](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1s2Il7hNop_TFs4x6FNc5kdeRGttIGLJtMPhz8onPxTlqKw/viewform) is now due weds before class.

## Textbook

“The Analysis of Biological Data” by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter

- It is highly recommended, but not required. Any edition will do.
- Students who have bought the book have really appreciated it, especially when they read it before class

### Equipment Requirement

As a modern statistics course, we conduct data analysis, generate figures etc in the R statistical language. Every student needs to bring a laptop computer with R installed to the class (we will help you with R installation in the first class). Email us with questions and / or if you cannot bring a computer to class, and we will work something out.

Other resources / books of interest / resources we may use / you might find useful can be found on the [Additional Resources page](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).

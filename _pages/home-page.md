**ANNOUNCEMENTS (2/10)**

I have generated some R  Youtube videos. I'm doing them in order of your priorities from the class poll [more may come].  
Also **please send me any R questions you have**. Ideally this would be from a real world problem / project and/or an something for a different class. If you send me these today, I'll try to integrate them into tomorrow's learning.

## Textbook

“The Analysis of Biological Data” by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter

- It is highly recommended, but not required. Any edition will do.
- Students who have bought the book have really appreciated it, especially when they read it before class

### Equipment Requirement

As a modern statistics course, we conduct data analysis, generate figures etc in the R statistical language. Every student needs to bring a laptop computer with R installed to the class (we will help you with R installation in the first class). Email us with questions and / or if you cannot bring a computer to class, and we will work something out.

Other resources / books of interest / resources we may use / you might find useful can be found on the [Additional Resources page](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).

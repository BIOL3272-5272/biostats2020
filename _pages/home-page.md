**UPDATE. April 1**. 
I've uploaded additional resources for interpretting/thinking about general linear models - focussing on the olympic example. (1) [Intro to the data](https://youtu.be/8zMLr6_s6Gw), (2) [Calculating Type I Sums of Squares](https://youtu.be/nT5AEr2QhlA), (3) [Interpretting the anova table](https://youtu.be/_gyBeXj6QJ8), (4) [Interpretting model coefficients and their significance](https://youtu.be/hh-vX2T_n9U),  (5) [Calcualting $r^2$ and adjusted $r^2$](https://youtu.be/6TMp8LuMhFc).      


**UPDATE. March 31st**
Final project described!  More details to come [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_0GlIpWuovQzB__iWQI1adMOR8JsYIAVTte8w0SZ4xs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Textbook

“The Analysis of Biological Data” by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter

- It is highly recommended, but not required. Any edition will do.
- Students who have bought the book have really appreciated it, especially when they read it before class

### Equipment Requirement

As a modern statistics course, we conduct data analysis, generate figures etc in the R statistical language. Every student needs to bring a laptop computer with R installed to the class (we will help you with R installation in the first class). Email us with questions and / or if you cannot bring a computer to class, and we will work something out.

Other resources / books of interest / resources we may use / you might find useful can be found on the [Additional Resources page](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).

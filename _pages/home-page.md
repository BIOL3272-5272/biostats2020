**UPDATE. April 6**. 

1. I've posted  the [key](https://youtu.be/BWb8BLz8jMM) for todays classwork on likelihood on likelihood [i will timestamp soon]

2. Homework for weds is posted  [Homework_31](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/151855/assignments/1069493), [note i messed up the assumptions for logistic regression, there is no need for normality of residuals.. this is in fact impossible]

3. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SmfNPVikUTWwsOTCa3vbHax1XRxG7yzcCKeKmvlZ9Q/edit) the final major assessment shortly [due monday at 10 pm, it will be taken nearly directly from classwork].


4. On monday we will work through that and have a review. On weds we will go over a brief intro to random effects and talk about our potential projects. On friday more random effects. Then we will have mondays for working on projects and the other days for going over material that will likely help many of you in your projects [aside from incorporation of the relevant remaining material into your projects [which many of you will need], there will be no major assessment or test on  material covered after this week].

5. Please email me with ideas for a project, or guidance on how to get started if you have no clue [I imagine that those of you without a data source will need help getting something off the ground... if so, include your  scientific & statistical interests and what you hope to get out of the project]

## Textbook

“The Analysis of Biological Data” by Michael Whitlock and Dolph Schluter

- It is highly recommended, but not required. Any edition will do.
- Students who have bought the book have really appreciated it, especially when they read it before class

### Equipment Requirement

As a modern statistics course, we conduct data analysis, generate figures etc in the R statistical language. Every student needs to bring a laptop computer with R installed to the class (we will help you with R installation in the first class). Email us with questions and / or if you cannot bring a computer to class, and we will work something out.

Other resources / books of interest / resources we may use / you might find useful can be found on the [Additional Resources page](https://biol3272-5272.github.io/biostats2020/resources/).
